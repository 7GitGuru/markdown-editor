### Technologies Used:

1. **React:** The project is built using the React JavaScript library. React enables the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to building user interfaces.

2. **react-markdown:** This library is utilized for rendering Markdown content into React components. It supports various plugins, including `rehype-raw` for rendering HTML within Markdown.

3. **react-router-dom:** Used for implementing client-side routing within the React application. It enables navigation between different views without a full page reload.


### Project Structure:

- **Home Page (`/`):** The main page of the application is the home page, featuring a Markdown editor where users can input text and see the live preview of the formatted content. 

- **Documentation Page (`/documentation`):** This page provides documentation on Markdown syntax. 

### External Link:

The "Go to Documentation" button on the home page redirects users to the [GitHub documentation on Markdown basics](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 
### Styling:

Styling is done using CSS, providing a clean and responsive design. The buttons are styled with distinctive colors and positioned strategically for a better user experience.
